This repo contains a rough Java translation of the C++ OpenGL application created in Ben Cook's Udemy course:

https://www.udemy.com/course/graphics-with-modern-opengl/

It is still somewhat in progress, but the code seems to be working in much the same way and should give some helpful examples of how to create an OpenGL application in Java.

My version of the C++ application created by following the above course can be found here:
